# Civil_War_Rail_Fence_Cipher
Fun user interface that can be implemented as a game for children to learn about the workings of ciphers by encoding their own messages in the same way commanders used to encode during the American Civil War. The code itself takes in a message as a string and outputs the corresponding rail fence cipher for that message.
